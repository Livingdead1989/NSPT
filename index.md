# Testing

We have tested this application on the following devices:

* Cisco CSR1000v
* Aruba JL256A 2930F
* HP J9729A 2920
* HP J8698A 5412 zl 

# Demonstration

A short demonstration of the CLI version in use, this showcases the help menu, a minimal test just using the device IP address, both verbose and report mode with custom report path. Included in the demonstration are good examples where all tests pass as well as showing error and case handling and failed devices.
