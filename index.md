COM617 Project Files - Network device Security Policy Tester application

The aim of this project is to create a software solution to perform the automated testing of network equipment to meet the company’s security policies and to produce a report of the testing.


## Project Requirements

The application must perform automated network security tests. 

1. The tests must check the network device configuration for: 
   1. Telnet must be disabled,
   2. The privileged exec password must be configured,
   3. SNMPv1 with a community string of “public” should not be configured.
2. The user must be able to initiate the test manually. 
3. The automated testing must produce a report whether each test passed or failed on each device. 
4. The platform must use open source software.
